	PARTS NOT DONE OR ARE DIFFERENTLY IMPLEMENTED:

1) I implemented thr game rooms by .join(room) functions
2) the turn and symbol are sent from server to the client
3) the turn and symbol assigned to clients are console.log in console.
4) Other things are implemented as per said.
5) I didn't implement the condition where the invalid moves are left and   box is not complete. Winning condition is only when box is filled.
